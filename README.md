# AirShow

A free, open-source, cross-platform screen mirroring receiver. Turn any computer into a wireless display that accepts screen mirrors from phones, tablets, and other computers.

**Think AirServer, but free.**

## Supported Protocols

| Protocol | Source Devices | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| **AirPlay** | iPhone, iPad, Mac | Working (needs device testing) |
| **Google Cast** | Android, Chrome browser | Infrastructure built (auth signatures pending) |
| **Miracast** | Windows 10/11 | Infrastructure built (MS-MICE, needs device testing) |
| **DLNA** | Any DLNA controller app | Working (needs device testing) |

## Features

- **Multi-protocol** --- one app receives from any device
- **Fullscreen receiver** with correct aspect ratio (letterboxed when needed)
- **Connection status HUD** showing device name and protocol
- **Audio playback** with mute toggle
- **Hardware H.264 decode** with automatic software fallback
- **Security controls** --- device approval prompts, PIN pairing, LAN-only filtering
- **Windowed mode** (`--windowed` flag) for development and testing
- **Close button + mute** appear on mouse hover

## Quick Start

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

Install dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install \
  qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev qt6-multimedia-dev \
  libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
  gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
  gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-qt6 \
  libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev \
  libssl-dev libavahi-client-dev libupnp-dev libplist-dev \
  libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler \
  ninja-build cmake pkg-config
```

Build and run:

```bash
./build-and-run.sh
```

Or with windowed mode:

```bash
./build-and-run.sh --windowed
```

### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install qt@6 gstreamer openssl libplist libupnp protobuf ninja cmake
./build-and-run.sh
```

### Windows (MSYS2 MinGW-64)

```cmd
build-and-run.bat
```

The script will tell you which MSYS2 packages to install if missing.

## Manual Build

```bash
cmake --preset linux-debug    # or macos-debug / windows-msys2-debug
cmake --build build/linux-debug
./build/linux-debug/airshow
```

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Language | C++17 |
| GUI | Qt 6.8+ / Qt Quick / QML |
| Media Pipeline | GStreamer 1.26.x |
| Video Rendering | qml6glsink (zero-copy GL) |
| AirPlay | UxPlay (embedded) |
| DLNA | libupnp (pupnp) |
| Google Cast | protobuf + OpenSSL TLS |
| Miracast | MS-MICE (TCP/RTSP) |
| Discovery | Avahi (Linux), Bonjour (macOS/Windows) |
| Build | CMake + Ninja |
| Crypto | OpenSSL 3.x |

## Security

AirShow includes three security layers:

1. **Device Approval** --- new devices trigger an Allow/Deny dialog before mirroring starts. Approved devices are remembered.
2. **PIN Pairing** --- optional 4-digit PIN displayed on the receiver. Devices must enter the correct PIN to connect.
3. **LAN-Only Filter** --- connections from non-RFC1918 IPs are rejected. VPN interfaces are excluded from listener binding.

## Known Limitations

- **Google Cast authentication** requires precomputed RSA signatures from a certified Cast receiver (e.g., AirReceiver APK). The infrastructure is complete but placeholder signatures are used until real ones are extracted.
- **Miracast** uses MS-MICE (infrastructure mode) only. Wi-Fi Direct Miracast is not supported due to unstable Linux kernel/wpa_supplicant P2P APIs.
- **Android Miracast** support varies by OEM. Most Android devices use Wi-Fi Direct only and won't connect via MS-MICE.
- **HDCP content** (Netflix, Disney+, etc.) is blocked at the protocol level by DRM --- this is not a bug.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cd build/linux-debug && ctest --output-on-failure

# Run tests for a specific protocol
ctest -R test_airplay
ctest -R test_dlna
ctest -R test_cast
ctest -R test_miracast
ctest -R test_security
```

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. The codebase follows these conventions:

- C++17, Qt Quick/QML, GStreamer
- Pure virtual `ProtocolHandler` interface for each protocol
- `MediaPipeline` with pluggable modes (appsrc, uridecodebin, webrtcbin, MPEG-TS)
- GTest for unit and integration tests
- CMake with presets for Linux/macOS/Windows

Open source (license TBD).
